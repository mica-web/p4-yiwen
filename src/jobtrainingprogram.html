<h2>Safety Skills</h2>
<p>Because our trainees, customers, donors and employees deserve nothing less, safety is at the center of all Second
    Chance operations. To perpetuate this culture of safety, the unparalleled services of OSHA (Occupational Safety &
    Health Association) are enlisted. Representatives provide trainees the industry-coveted OSHA 10 Certification, along
    with Lead & Asbestos Recognition and Safe Removal training. Beyond this, trainees participate in an EMS (Emergency
    Medical Services) Course in AED, CPR and first aid.</p>
<p>Beyond the general safety and health instruction provided in standardized classes, Second Chance provides specialized
    training based on case studies formed during past work. This series of lessons is taught by those who learned
    them—primarily by our senior employees, supervisors, and field managers. In this way, valuable knowledge gained
    through years of hands-on experience is retained in the collective conscious of our organization.</p>

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
<p>After Boot Camp—a rigorous 2-week evaluation and qualifying period— trainees proceed with hands-on instruction in the
    proper use of numerous types of power tools, hand tools and equipment. This phase of the program runs for 16 weeks,
    during which time students receive first-hand experience:</p>
<ul class="body-ul">
    <li>recognizing material types, values, and sizes;</li>
    <li>deconstructing structures and salvaging objects built from a variety of materials;</li>
    <li>becoming competent in the safe and effective use of all manual and power tools;</li>
    <li>achieving a thorough understanding of maximizing the value and performance of tools as a means of increasing the
        tools’ efficiency and longevity; and
        understanding OSHA-based safety and health training for all field employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program is punctuated with a series of strategic 4-hour modules. These seminars include:</p>
<ul class="body-ul">
    <li>Sustainability Orientation – Trainees gain a clear understanding of the meaning of sustainability, as well
        as
        how to apply sustainability practices to their own lives.</li>
    <li>LEED Orientation – The LEED Rating system measures the environmental soundness of a building by evaluating
        the
        design and construction practices that brought it into existence. Each trainee is introduced to the entire
        system with an emphasis on the value of recycling demolition waste, material reuse, regional materials, and
        recycling building material.</li>
    <li>Second Chance Values – The trainee is formally introduced to the values, mission and culture of Second
        Chance as
        a genuine triple-bottom-line social enterprise.</li>
</ul>
