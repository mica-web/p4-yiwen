        <h2>Donate Items</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Second Chance can give new life to old doors and windows, hardware and tools, ironwork and mantles, and
                gently used
                furniture. If you have building materials, kitchen appliances, bathroom fixtures, tubs, sinks,
                accessories,
                household goods, garden elements, collections, lighting or unique architectural items in good to
                excellent
                condition, please consider donating them to Second Chance. Working vehicles, items with historical
                value, and
                certain “oddities” are welcome, too.</p>
            <p>We enjoy building ongoing donor relationships with various businesses and organizations, and we’re proud
                to have so
                many repeat donors who value the efficiency and excellence we’ve gained through two decades of
                experience. Not only
                do donors benefit from a tax deduction, but they contribute to the growth of an organization that is
                changing lives
                through job training, salvaging our regional architectural history, saving consumers money, and
                protecting the
                planet through resource conservation and waste stream diversion.</p>

        <h2>Donate a House</h2>
        <div>
            <p>If you’d like a no-pressure consultation to learn more about our deconstruction services or the
                significant tax and
                other benefits associated with deconstructing rather demolishing a home or building, please fill in the
                requested
                information below. A trained Second Chance team member will contact you to learn about your project and
                help you
                understand the process and rewards of donating a structure to us to use in our job training program. You
                may also
                call us at 410-385-1700 to discover if home donation is right for you.</p>

        <h2>Donate Money</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Because Second Chance, Inc. is an IRS recognized 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, all monetary gifts
                shared with us
                are tax deductible. They are also greatly appreciated, because it takes substantial revenue to operate
                and expand
                our social enterprise. To help us facilitate more “second chances” through a financial contribution of
                any amount,
                please use our PayPal "Donate" Link or fill out the following form and a SC representative will contact
                you to
                facilitate your gift.</p>

        <h2>Donate Time</h2>
        <div>
            <p>We realize our mission is too broad to accomplish by ourselves. Your talents, passions, and availability
                can have a
                profound impact on individuals and the local community through Second Chance. Your specialized
                experience can create
                opportunities for more and better second chances, while simply showing up with a smile and willingness
                to work is
                fantastic, too. We have plenty of “general help” needs to keep you busy. Groups from 2 to 200 can be
                plugged into
                the action, and they consistently report a positive and rewarding service experience.</p>
            <p>To volunteer or find out more about it, please fill out the form below. Volunteers and groups are here
                every week,
                and we look forward to integrating you into the Second Chance family, too!</p>
